{"name":"WordPress Image Resizer","tagline":"Resize WordPress images on the fly","body":"# WordPress Image Resizer\r\nBased on the idea of [Aqua Resizer](https://github.com/sy4mil/Aqua-Resizer) from [Syamil MJ](http://aquagraphite.com/) -- Thanks\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis small script will allow you to resize & crop WordPress images uploaded via the media uploader. It relies on WP's native functions to resize the images, and checks if there is an already resized version of the image so that it won't be wasting your server's resources to regenerate the images.\r\n\r\n### Why use it?\r\nThere are a couple of image resizing scripts out there that already have this function. Some authors simply use the add_image_size() function to define custom image sizes that will be generated for each image uploaded via the media uploader. I mostly find these methods somewhat a little complicated to use, or having some limitations or too resource intensive.\r\n\r\nWith Aqua Resizer, the only required inputs are the URL and width. It's easy, fast & efficient. Additionally, you have the additional options such as the height, crop, and array return.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nYou can use the solution as plugin or include the functions in your theme.\r\n\r\n**As Plugin**\r\n\r\nInstall the plugin and activate in backend. After activation you can use all functions.\r\n1. Upload the file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\r\n1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\r\n\r\n**In your theme**\r\n\r\nInclude the the file with follow syntax in your `functions.php` of your theme and now you can also use the functions. \r\n```\r\nrequire_once( 'aq_resizer.php' );\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can use the different functions.\r\n\r\nThe follow is only an small example, you find more functions, possibilities and examples of source on the [wiki](https://github.com/bueltge/WP-Image-Resizer/wiki) to this repository\r\nYou can then use it in your theme as such:\r\n\r\n**Echo img-tag**\r\n```\r\n  $args = array( 'url' => 'your img url', 'width' => 'your wish for width' );\r\n  wp_img_resizer( $args );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Return single value or array with url, width, height**\r\n```\r\n  $args = array( 'url' => 'your img url', 'width' => 'your wish for width' );\r\n  wp_img_resizer_src( $args );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Shortcode for an gallery**\r\n```\r\n[resizer_gallery width='120']\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Also the first solution if Aqua Resizer**\r\n```\r\n  aq_resize( $img_url,$width );\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore usage instructions and examples can be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/bueltge/WP-Image-Resizer/wiki)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* WordPress (also Multisite) version 3.3 and later (tested at 3.5-RC4)\r\n* PHP 5.2.4\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n* Use as plugin or\r\n* use in your plugin or theme as library\r\n\r\n## Other Notes\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI'm German and my English might be gruesome here and there. So please be patient with me and let me know of typos or grammatical farts. Thanks\r\n\r\n### Contact & Feedback\r\nThe plugin is designed and developed by ([Frank BÃ¼ltge](http://bueltge.de)) based on the idea from [Syamil MJ](http://aquagraphite.com/)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you like the plugin or you hate it or whatever ... Please fork it, add an issue for ideas and bugs.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nGood news, this plugin is free for everyone!
